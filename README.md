On my last commit, I went around looking for ways to organize a little better from going from sequence of layers from the top to the bottom of the website and labeling them by numbers. Each layer I did, I would do the css right after unless they have the same specs such as the almost every section had display: flex, but only half of them would have flex-direction as a column. I adjusted many things as I experimented as I went and googled how to make things they should be.
